# Simple-encoding
### Welcome to Simple-Encoding python script

This project includes a simple python script for compress (and encode) a basic .txt file.
The compression method is very simple.
First of all, all the sentences in the document are preprocessed creating a dictionary of associations. Each entry, in the dictionary, consists in a small portion of a single token (word granularity) which it is mapped with a single and progessive character, in the Unicode table. 
This python script include both a encoding and decoding method.
